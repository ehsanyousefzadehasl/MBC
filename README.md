## Morris Mano's Basic Computer
The aim of this repository is to develope the basic computer taught in Morris Mano's computer system architecture book with Verilog HDL (I will try to make another repository about Verilog and Digital Design).

### How to work with Modelsim?
First, try to install the free version of Modelsim (assumption is that you are a student). Then, easily make a new project, then make new files (verilog) or add them (if you like to use another editor like VS-code that has extensions for verilog HDL). After compiling all of your files (and if you don't have any errors), start simulations. Then, add the signals that you want to see them on your waveform. Additioinally, always try to write test benches (I say it because I guess if you have worked with Alter's Quartus you tend to change the signals manually). See the written test benches in this repository to get an idea how to do it easily. Finally, if you need to know and see more [this - Modelsim starters](https://www.nandland.com/vhdl/tutorials/tutorial-modelsim-simulation-walkthrough.html) and [this - Test Bench Writing](https://verilogguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/verilog/testbench.html) can be useful.

### Morris Mano Basic Computer
This computer is one addressed computer because or accumulator-based computer because in all of the operations always one operand is AC (Accumulator Register) and the other one can be a register or memory word or immediate value [Read More](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-instruction-formats-zero-one-two-three-address-instruction/).
